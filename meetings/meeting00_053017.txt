MEETING 00


Text proc:
* Need: numeric representation 
   * Convert the cleaned token notes into numbers
* Need: separate time 
   * Time in midi_csv is in midiclocks (second numeric in each token)
   * We want time measured in: mili-secs
   * Problem: number in midi-csv is in midiclock


AI Stuff:
* Problem: specifics
* Come up with good metric
   * Idea: ratio, measure distances from C
* Supervised model: 
   * Option: go online and research music theory to manually find metric that we can put into (warning: subjective)
      * Use that specific metric to inform the machine
      * Have to tell the machine relationship between variables 
      * Research ‘good music’
* Unsupervised methods → find latent factors
   * Models we can use: Multiple-regression, k-nearest-neighbor
      * Problem: solidify statistical model we are using
   * Pattern-seeking: learned metric (latent pattern in data)
      * Use THAT metric to help us inform model
   * Inform future compositions (possibly?)
   * Specifics:
      * Method 1: Clustering: sequences that sound good
      * Method 2: ??
* Solution(?): tell machine to play chord at specific time (x = time (break into milisecs), y = output note (note played or not)) 
   * Engineering stuff:
      * Relationship between x and y is the metric
      * Put into matrix
      * 3-note chords for simple case
   * Supervised: set this relationship
   * Unsupervised: machine finds latent pattern

Goals:
* AI/Data Processing
   * Find out what we need to do:
   * Specific metrics for data proc
   * Defining “what is problem” with data-proc


* Text-processing:
   * Quantify pitch as a numeric (distance from middle C, negative is bass, positive treble)
   * Quantify time
      * What are the timestamps
      * Convert timestamps to milisecs
   * Setting each point of data as two-dimensional object (time and pitch)


* Tools to Train With:
   * TensorFlow → data-processing library
   * Git → sharing and editing code quickly


* New Meeting
   * Next agenda:
      * Meet other engineers (hopefully everyone should come)
      * Discuss potential solutions to data proc problem
      * Discuss engineering progress
   * Friday 060917 
      * 7:00 p.m. PDT | 10:00 p.m. EST | 7:30 a.m. IST | 10:00 a.m. SGT
      * Google Hangouts
